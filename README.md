# Menu Games

This is an application that features a restaurant menu, but the code was slightly altered to have a little fun with the "Specials" tile.  The "Specials" tile now takes the user to random single category menu pages instead of the actual page featuring the menu specials.  To accomplish this, the home-snippet.html file was altered dynamically by entering a random category titled "short_name" into the onclick function call to execute the code.  This application uses JavaScript, Ajax, Bootstrap, and jQuery.
